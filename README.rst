ALPS 2 QUTIP ++ 
=================

By now, this project defines a partial interface between ALPS[https://github.com/ALPSCore/ALPSCore] and QuTiP[https://github.com/qutip/qutip]. The idea is to be able to load models and geometries from xml model and lattices libraries defined following the ALPS syntax, and produce objects which are compatible with QuTiP.
